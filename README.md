# SmooFaceNet
An open source face recognition engine.

Author: @wotchin
# Introduction
Let us see something about this project now.
## What is this project?
This project is an open source project about
 face recognition. In the project, we implement a face 
 recognition engine that could one-shot train and predict
 unknown faces.

## Why did this?
JUST FOR FUN!

# Principle of SmooFaceNet
We use deep CNN as the basic network. In this project,
 we implemented some cnn, such as VGG16, VIPL face net, 
 ResNet20 and XCEPTION and so on.

We use AM-Softmax loss as the loss function here, rather than 
triple loss or other metric learning loss. This is because 
AM-Softmax has less training time, but the accuracy 
did not decrease.
